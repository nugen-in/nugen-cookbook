Nugen Intelligence develops domain-aligned foundation models and agentic workflows.

The Nugen Cookbook provides example code and guides for common tasks using the [Nugen API](https://docs.nugen.in). These examples demonstrate how to leverage Nugen's technology in various regulated industries.

## Getting Started

1. Create a [free Nugen account](https://nugen.in/request-access?ref=githubcookbook) to obtain an API key.
2. Set up your environment:
   - Set an environment variable: `NUGEN_API_KEY=<your API key>`
   - Or create an `.env` file in your project root: `NUGEN_API_KEY=<your API key>`

Most code examples are in Python, but the concepts apply to any language. For usage examples in other languages (cURL, GO, JavaScript, PHP, and Java), refer to our [API reference](https://docs.nugen.in/api-reference/).
