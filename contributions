# Contributions Summary for Cookbooks 9, 8, 5, and 6

## Cookbook 9:

- **Built a Production-Ready RAG System**: Implemented a secure, efficient, modular PDF-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with Nugen API and Qdrant, including semantic chunking, metadata tracking, and structured query processing.
- **Logging and Feedback Loops**: Added comprehensive audit logging for queries, system responses, and token usage to enable feedback loops and system monitoring.
- **Security Improvements**: Enforced integrity checks (SHA256 validation) on PDF files before processing and secured user queries via sanitization.

## Cookbook 8: Enhanced PDF Querying with Nugen APIs

- **Secure API Key Handling**: Replaced hardcoded Nugen API keys with environment variable loading to strengthen security practices.
- **Improved Text Preprocessing and Prompt Engineering**: Introduced text sanitization functions and enhanced the structure of prompts to boost embedding and response quality.
- **Interactive Query System with Q&A Logging**: Enabled real-time, unlimited user querying over PDFs with persistent Q&A logging for auditing and traceability.

## Cookbook 5: 

- **Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting for Policy Transformation**: Added a structured CoT-based system to convert help center articles into logically ordered, executable routines optimized for LLMs.
- **Routine QA Validator**: Introduced a validation step using LLM inference to ensure completeness, legal compliance, clarity, and robustness of generated routines.
- **Parallelized Processing**: Enhanced the pipeline performance by processing articles concurrently using a ThreadPoolExecutor for faster batch execution.

## Cookbook 6: 

- **Secure API Key Management and HTTPS Enforcement**: Shifted API key handling to environment variables and mandated HTTPS for all API communications.
- **Robust Error Handling and Input Validation**: Validated input structures, implemented try-except blocks, added request timeouts, and improved logging practices by masking sensitive information.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrated timing and cost tracking to monitor API latency and enhance developer visibility into system performance.
