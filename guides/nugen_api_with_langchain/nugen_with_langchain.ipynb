      "Artificial Intelligence refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Learning\n",
      "2. Problem-solving\n",
      "3. Reasoning\n",
      "4. Perception\n",
      "5. Language understanding\n",
      "\n",
      "AI systems can be categorized into two types:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Narrow or Weak AI**: Designed to perform a specific task, such as facial recognition, language translation, or playing chess.\n",
      "2. **General or Strong AI**: A hypothetical AI system that possesses human-like intelligence, capable of performing any intellectual task.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Machine Learning (ML)**\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In traditional programming, a computer is given a set of rules to follow. In contrast, ML algorithms allow computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Types of Machine Learning**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm is trained on labeled data to learn the relationship between input and output.\n",
      "2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm discovers patterns and relationships in unlabeled data.\n",
      "3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Applications of AI and ML**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Virtual Assistants**: Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use AI and ML to understand voice commands and respond accordingly.\n",
      "2. **Image Recognition**: Facebook's facial recognition, Google Photos, and self-driving cars use ML to identify objects and people.\n",
      "3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis rely on AI and ML to understand human language.\n",
      "4. **Predictive Maintenance**: AI and ML are used to predict equipment failures and schedule maintenance in industries like manufacturing and healthcare.\n",
      "5. **Healthcare**: AI and ML are applied in medical diagnosis, personalized medicine, and patient outcome prediction.\n",
