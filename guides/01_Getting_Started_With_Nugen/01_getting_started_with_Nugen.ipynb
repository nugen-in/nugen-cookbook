    "3. On the API settings page, click on the \"Create Key\" button. A modal window will appear, prompting you to give your key a descriptive name. Choose a name that reflects the purpose or project you'll be using the key for. You can create as many keys as you want within your account (note that rate and message limits apply at the account level, not the API key level).\n",
