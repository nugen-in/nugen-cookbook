In this lesson, you will learn how to chat with a PDF using Nugen's embeddings and text completion endpoints. We would go through the following:
1. Parse the Pdf documents and create chunks 
2. Create chunk embeddings and index it in vector database
3. Answer user queries based on contextual search from these embeddings. 

In order to store the embeddings, we will use Qdrant vector database.
