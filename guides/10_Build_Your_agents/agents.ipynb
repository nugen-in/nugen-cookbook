    "The \"instructions\" field is your agent's primary guidance system. Here are some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be specific: Clearly define your agent's role and domain expertise\n",
    "2. Set boundaries: Specify what the agent should and shouldn't do\n",
    "3. Define tone: Indicate how formal, friendly, or technical the agent should be\n",
    "4. Include workflows: Outline how the agent should approach different types of questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "json\"instructions\": \"You are a customer service assistant for NuGen Electronics. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide helpful, friendly responses about our products and services. \n",
    "2. For technical questions, ask for product model numbers before giving specific advice. \n",
    "3. For pricing questions, provide ranges rather than exact figures. \n",
    "4. Always suggest contacting our support team for complex issues.\"\n",
    "5. Powerful Demonstrations\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrations teach by example. For best results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cover key scenarios: Include examples of common use cases\n",
    "2. Show edge cases: Demonstrate how to handle difficult situations\n",
    "3. Maintain consistency: Ensure all examples follow your desired style and approach\n",
    "4. Quality over quantity: A few excellent demonstrations often outperform many mediocre ones"
