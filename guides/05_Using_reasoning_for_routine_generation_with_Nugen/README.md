# **Using Reasoning for Routine Generation with Nugen API**
 
This code demonstrates how to generate programmatically executable routines from help center articles using the Nugen API. The goal is to transform external-facing help center content into internal-facing routines that can be used by a large language model (LLM) to handle customer service tasks effectively.

##**Importing Necessary Libraries**


```python
import requests
from IPython.display import display, HTML
import pandas as pd
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import csv

url_api_server = "https://api.nugen.in"
api_key =  <GET YOUR NUGEN API KEYS> # Replace with your actual Nugen API key
MODEL = "nugen-flash-instruct"
```

1. requests: A library to make HTTP
2. requests to the Nugen API.
3. pandas: A library to handle data manipulation and analysis.
4. ThreadPoolExecutor: A tool to run multiple tasks concurrently, speeding up processing.
5. csv: A module to read and write CSV files.

##**Setting Up the Nugen API**


```python
class NugenAPIClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url, api_key):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.api_key = api_key

    def chat_completions_create(self, model, messages, max_tokens=400, temperature=1):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/inference/completions"
        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
        prompt = "\n".join([message["content"] for message in messages])

        payload = {
            "model": model,
            "prompt": prompt,
            "max_tokens": max_tokens,
            "temperature": temperature
        }

        response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()
        else:
            raise Exception(f"Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")

# Instantiate Nugen client
client = NugenAPIClient(base_url=url_api_server, api_key=api_key)

```

**url:** The endpoint for the Nugen API where we send our requests.

**headers:** Includes the authorization token for API access and specifies that we're sending JSON data.

##**Defining the Routine Generation Function**


```python
CONVERSION_PROMPT = """
You are a helpful assistant tasked with taking an external facing help center article and converting it into an internal-facing programmatically executable routine optimized for an LLM.
The LLM using this routine will be tasked with reading the policy, answering incoming questions from customers, and helping drive the case toward resolution.

Please follow these instructions:
1. **Review the customer service policy carefully** to ensure every step is accounted for. It is crucial not to skip any steps or policies.
2. **Organize the instructions into a logical, step-by-step order**, using the specified format.
3. **Use the following format**:
   - **Main actions are numbered** (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
   - **Sub-actions are lettered** under their relevant main actions (e.g., 1a, 1b).
      **Sub-actions should start on new lines**
   - **Specify conditions using clear 'if...then...else' statements** (e.g., 'If the product was purchased within 30 days, then...').
   - **For instructions that require more information from the customer**, provide polite and professional prompts to ask for additional information.
   - **For actions that require data from external systems**, write a step to call a function using backticks for the function name (e.g., `call the check_delivery_date function`).
      - **If a step requires the customer service agent to take an action** (e.g., process a refund), generate a function call for this action (e.g., `call the process_refund function`).
      - **Define any new functions** by providing a brief description of their purpose and required parameters.
   - **If there is an action an assistant can perform on behalf of the user**, include a function call for this action (e.g., `call the change_email_address function`), and ensure the function is defined with its purpose and required parameters.
      - This action may not be explicitly defined in the help center article, but can be done to help the user resolve their inquiry faster.
   - **The step prior to case resolution should always be to ask if there is anything more you can assist with**.
   - **End with a final action for case resolution**: calling the `case_resolution` function should always be the final step.
4. **Ensure compliance** by making sure all steps adhere to company policies, privacy regulations, and legal requirements.
5. **Handle exceptions or escalations** by specifying steps for scenarios that fall outside the standard policy.

**Important**: If at any point you are uncertain, respond with "I don't know."

Please convert the customer service policy into the formatted routine, ensuring it is easy to follow and execute programmatically.

# Read articles from CSV

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

**generate_routine(policy):** This function sends a request to the Nugen API to convert a help center article (policy) into an internal-facing routine.
  1. payload: Contains the request parameters, including the prompt which outlines how to format the routine.
  2. response: Receives the response from the API and extracts the generated routine from it.
  3. Exception handling: Catches any errors that occur during the request and prints an error message.

##**Processing Articles Concurrently**



```python
# Function to process each article and generate routine
def process_article(article):
    routine = generate_routine(article['content'])
    return {"policy": article['policy'], "content": article['content'], "routine": routine}

# Execute routine generation concurrently
with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(process_article, articles))

1. process_article(article): Calls the generate_routine function for each article and returns a dictionary with the policy, content, and generated routine.

2. Reading Articles: Loads help center articles from a CSV file into the articles list.

3. Concurrent Processing: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor to process multiple articles at once, speeding up the routine generation.

1. **Creating a DataFrame**: Converts the results into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and viewing.
2. **Displaying the Data:** Defines a function display_formatted_dataframe(df) to format and display the DataFrame in a readable HTML format.

#**Summary**

This code converts help center articles into internal-facing routines using the Nugen API. It processes multiple articles concurrently to improve efficiency and displays the results in an easily readable format. By following the steps outlined in this documentation, you can adapt and use the code for your own routine generation needs.
