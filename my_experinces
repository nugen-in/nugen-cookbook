# Cookbook 6 - How to Create Embeddings with Nugen

### Security in Shared Notebooks
Utilizing environment variables for API key management improved security, enabling safe sharing and version control while preventing exposure of sensitive credentials.

### Minimalist Enhancements Can Have Big Impact
Incorporating validation, error handling, and secure logging resulted in a resilient codebase that’s easier to debug, proving the value of small but impactful improvements.

### Lightweight Retrieval is Effective
Cosine similarity for comparing vector embeddings demonstrated efficiency for small-scale retrieval, while advanced tools like Qdrant offer scalability for larger applications.

### Educating Through Best Practices
Applied robust coding standards to ensure workflows are secure and easy for other developers to replicate and adapt to real-world use cases.

## Experience
Through hands-on work with the Nugen API, I gained expertise in transforming text into vector embeddings, using cosine similarity for relevance checks, and improving security and reliability through thoughtful enhancements.
